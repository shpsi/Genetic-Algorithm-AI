# Genetic-Algorithm
A genetic algorithm implementation in Java

We have programmed a Genetic Algorithm in Java that takes an image as
input and approximates the image using circles/rectangles of different
dimensions and colors

Steps to run the algorithm:

First put the image file (jpg) in the same directory as the algorithm files

Now running the code is simple. Just provide the image name (without any extension) as the first argument to the java command

Example: java GeneticAlgorithm my_image
